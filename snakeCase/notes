str = str.replace(/[^\w\s]|_/g, "")
         .replace(/\s+/g, " ");
Removes everything except alphanumeric characters and whitespace, then collapses multiple adjacent characters to single spaces.

Detailed explanation:

\w is any digit, letter, or underscore.
\s is any whitespace.
[^\w\s] is anything that's not a digit, letter, whitespace, or underscore.
[^\w\s]|_ is the same as #3 except with the underscores added back in.
